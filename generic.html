								</ul>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sales trend.jpg" alt="" /></span>In this Project examined historical sales data to identify patterns, growth, and fluctuations over time. Analysed and understand market demand, and make informed decisions on pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies. Identified peak sales periods, and uncover any seasonal variations or irregularities. This analysis supports optimization of sales performance and strategic planning.</p>

								</ul>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Stock price.jpg" alt="" /></span>Stock price prediction involves forecasting the future value of a company’s stock based on historical data, market trends, and various financial indicators. Analysts use methods like technical analysis, which studies price patterns, and fundamental analysis, which evaluates company performance, earnings, and economic conditions. I employed the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The dataset was split into 65% training data and the remaining for testing. To enhance model performance, the MinMax Scaler was used to normalize the data, ensuring values fell within a consistent range. LSTM was chosen for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data. This approach aims to predict future stock prices by learning patterns from historical price trends and market behavior.</p>

								</ul>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/customer review.jpg" alt="" /></span>In this intern project, involves extracting insights from customer feedback to evaluate services. It typically includes sentiment analysis to determine whether reviews are positive, negative, or neutral, and topic modeling to identify common themes. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as text classification and word frequency analysis, businesses can better understand customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and enhance decision-making. It helps companies optimize customer experience, improve products, and refine marketing strategies based on real-time customer opinions.</p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/graph.png" alt="" /></span>In this project, involves RandomForestregression, Linear Regression machine learning algorithms to forecast a student’s performance based on various factors such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course. By employing regression models data is analyzed to predict future scores or categorize students into performance levels. This prediction helps educators identify students who may need additional support and tailor instructional strategies for better academic outcomes.</p>

								</ul>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/flight price.jpg" alt="" /></span>In flight price prediction, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves understanding the dataset by visualizing and summarizing key features such as departure times, airline carriers, flight duration, and ticket prices. EDA helps identify patterns, outliers, and correlations that affect prices. Feature Engineering (FE) is the process of creating new variables to improve model accuracy, such as extracting features like time of booking, day of the week, or seasonality. Both EDA and FE are essential for preparing data and extracting meaningful insights for accurate flight price predictions.</p>
